# Current State

## Purpose
This page is the operational orientation for the repo. Read it to see the active milestone, the current production priority, the top risks, and the next valid steps before broader coding begins.

## Current Milestone
`Milestone 0 - Canon and Repo Foundation`

The repo is still here because Milestone 1 implementation has not started yet, but the structural Orchard and Bridge readiness layer is now locked and must be treated as the source of truth.

## Current Priority
Begin Milestone 1 only through `docs/production/milestone_1_checklist.md`, Block A in `docs/production/milestone_1_implementation_order.md`, `docs/design/milestone_1_ownership_semantics.md`, and `docs/design/milestone_1_acceptance_criteria.md`.

## What Is Already True
- canon, design, and production hierarchy exists
- Orchard and Bridge is the active slice
- Milestone 1 acceptance criteria and the production-scale phase plan now exist
- Milestone 1 ownership semantics are now explicit in `docs/design/milestone_1_ownership_semantics.md`
- Milestone 1 implementation order is now explicit in `docs/production/milestone_1_implementation_order.md`
- Milestone 1 readiness, build, and review checks are now explicit in `docs/production/milestone_1_checklist.md`
- the Codex workflow and post-task documentation sync rule now exist
- runtime is already split into `data/`, `systems/`, and `runtime/`
- ID policy, save policy, schema reference, operating model, risk register, and title strategy exist
- starter canonical IDs are now frozen for the Orchard and Bridge slice
- starter save-state boundaries and smoke expectations are now documented for Milestone 1
- private co-op, additive growth, visible civic consequence, and money-as-fuel are already locked

## What Is Not Ready Yet
- the Orchard and Bridge slice is not yet fully implemented
- the ten Milestone 1 features are still unbuilt
- household semantics remain deferred to Milestone 2
- save smoke expectations are defined, but feature passes still need to verify them as real gameplay state lands

## Top Active Risks Right Now
- implementation beginning outside the Milestone 1 acceptance gate
- AI tools drifting from repo truth
- co-op being treated like two solo players sharing space
- NPC commentary drifting into chatter instead of state-based consequence

## Immediate Reinforcement Moves
- start with Block A only
- use `docs/production/milestone_1_checklist.md` at the start of each implementation pass
- keep personal and civic authorities singular and explicit
- verify the Milestone 1 save smoke expectations as each block becomes real

## Explicitly Out Of Scope Right Now
- extra districts or professions
- advanced AI NPCs
- taxes, inheritance, or abstract finance
- public-server or MMO assumptions
- lore expansion not attached to playable places or systems
- framework-heavy or UI-polish work

## Approved Next Baby Steps
1. implement Block A `apple source / pickup`
2. implement Block A `pie recipe / crafting`
3. implement Block A `pie sale / coin earning`
4. verify Block A against `docs/production/milestone_1_checklist.md` and `docs/design/milestone_1_acceptance_criteria.md`
5. do not begin Block B until Block A exit conditions are true

- `docs/production/development_operating_model.md`
- `docs/production/risk_register.md`

## Deferred Questions That Must Not Be Smuggled Into Code
- when and how household scope becomes a real gameplay authority
- whether `item/tree_deed` should become a visible receipt item later without becoming a second ownership authority
- what the first true household trade-off is in Milestone 2
- how deeper NPC memory and judgment systems are introduced after Milestone 1

## Final Rule
Do not start coding from partial context.
